## Notes

The introduction to Algorithms

## Big O

o of n grows linear with input

big o differently "As your input grows, how fast does computation or memory grow"

constants arent important because Big O is a estimation so "2n" is nowhere near as big as "n^2"
this is a rule of thumb

always worst case so even if there is a conditional that stops thread so "if (n === "E")" is ignored

types of complexity

- o(1)
- o(logn)
- o(n)
- o(nlogn)
- o(n^2)
- o(2^n)
- o(nl)
